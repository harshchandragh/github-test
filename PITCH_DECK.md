# JIRA VELOCITY PRO - EXECUTIVE PRESENTATION DECK
## Predictive Sprint Analytics for Atlassian Jira Cloud

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
**Jira Velocity Pro**
*AI-Powered Sprint Delay Prediction*

Presented by: [Your Name]
Date: [Today's Date]

Tagline: "What if Jira could predict sprint failures before they happen?"

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (Impact First)

### Enterprise Teams Waste $1.5M Annually on Sprint Delays

📊 **Statistics:**
- 67% of sprints miss their committed goals
- Average delay cost: $2,000 - $10,000 per sprint
- 30 delays/year per team × 10 teams = $1.5M lost

⚠️ **Root Cause:**
- Teams find out TOO LATE (in retrospectives)
- No predictive analytics in Jira today
- Reactive, not proactive sprint management

💭 **What Teams Say:**
*"We committed to 150 points but only completed 43. Again. Why didn't we see this coming?"*

---

## SLIDE 3: THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### 180,000+ Companies Use Jira Cloud

**Market Size:**
- Total Addressable Market: 180,000 Jira Cloud instances
- Target: Enterprise teams (10+ developers)
- Conservative Adoption: 5% = 9,000 customers
- Price Point: $50/month per instance
- **Annual Opportunity: $5.4M**

**Growth Trajectory:**

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION (Live Demo Screenshot)

### Jira Velocity Pro: Predictive + Prescriptive Analytics

**What It Does:**
1. ⚠️ **Predicts** sprint delays 3-5 days in advance
2. 💡 **Recommends** specific actions ("Offload 130 points")
3. 📊 **Visualizes** risk levels (Red/Yellow/Green)
4. 🤖 **AI-Powered** insights via Google Gemini 3 Flash

**Key Differentiator:**
Not just "you're behind schedule" → "Offload 130 points to align with your 43-point velocity"

## SLIDE 6: LIVE DATA EXAMPLE

### Real Results from 1,000 Jira Issues, 24 Sprints

**Critical Alert Example:**
```

Rightsize this sprint immediately by offloading 130 points
to align with team's demonstrated velocity of 43 points.
